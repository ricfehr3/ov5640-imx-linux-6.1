# ov5640-imx-linux-6.1
Patch to add ov5640 autofocus to the [IMX linux 6.1 kernel](https://github.com/nxp-imx/linux-imx/tree/lf-6.1.1-1.0.1), modified from Pinephone project (postmarketos).

This patch is mostly taken from [this patch](https://gitlab.manjaro.org/manjaro-arm/packages/core/linux-pinephone/-/blob/5.12-megi/media-ov5640-Implement-autofocus.patch). So thank you to Martijn Braam <martijn@brixit.nl> for the patch and Philip MÃ¼ller for the merge.

This patch also require's the ov5640 firmware provided for postmarketos: https://pkgs.postmarketos.org/package/master/postmarketos/aarch64/firmware-pine64-ov5640
